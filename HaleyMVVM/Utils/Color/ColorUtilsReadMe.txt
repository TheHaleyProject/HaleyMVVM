************* HUE *************
Hue is the color portion of the model, expressed as a number from 0 to 360 degrees:

   => Red falls between 0 and 60 degrees.
   => Yellow falls between 61 and 120 degrees.
   => Green falls between 121 and 180 degrees.
   => Cyan falls between 181 and 240 degrees.
   => Blue falls between 241 and 300 degrees.
   => Magenta falls between 301 and 360 degrees.

************* SATURATION *************
Saturation describes the amount of gray in a particular color, from 0 to 100 percent. Reducing this component toward zero introduces more gray and produces a faded effect. Sometimes, saturation appears as a range from 0 to 1, where 0 is gray, and 1 is a primary color.

************* BRIGHTNESS (VALUE) *************
Value works in conjunction with saturation and describes the brightness or intensity of the color, from 0 to 100 percent, where 0 is completely black, and 100 is the brightest and reveals the most color.
